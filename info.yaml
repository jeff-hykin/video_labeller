    done:
        - clean up the code
        - ability to slow down video
        - ability to go back 5 seconds
        - add notification when speed changes
        - make up/down be a speed change
        - add input controls for rate of speed and skipBackAmount
        - fix the edgecase bug of the measuring tool being too short
        - use localstorage to save the last-used feature name, multiplier, and skipBack
        - disable the scroll wheel speed increase/decrease
        - remove the chunk storage
        - fix the proportions to work on a smaller screen
        - add a controls-explaination section
        - ask about saving before opening new video
        - graph:
            - allow toggling the displayed features
        - make everything modular
        - refactor the way labelManager works
        - bug with pause and play
        
    todo:
        - remove the "labels" sub key since the file is pretty giant anyways
        - when a label is hidden, just hide the data, dont remove the name (that way the colors are kept)
        - update the how-to
        - add a help button/dialog
        
        - bugs:
            - skipBack/forward quickly messes up play/pause because too fast (switch to not play/pause and instead emit events for feature manager to update)
        
        - seperate out the graph settings
        - check that values are pairwise in order, throw error/sort if theyre not
        
        - allow saving null values for feature-doesnt-exist:
            - have a hold-down option
            - have a toggle option
        
        - add marker feature:
            - have pressing key instantly place markers
            - store markers seperately on videoLabelData
    
    later:
        - make data-loading more robust, filter the feature names to be ones that are formatted correctly for marker/graphs
        - add setting for having formatted/minified json
        - allow renaming the labels by clicking on them
        - add ability to change the save-as name
        - ability to open a folder and recursively get all videos
        - have the ability to add a list of youtube videos to evaluate in order
        - add settings for graph-refresh rate (add listener to hot-change the setinterval)
