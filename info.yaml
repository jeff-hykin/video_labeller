    description: An electron app designed to help people quickly label features on videos
    
    talk to Jiang about:
        - mouse movement option
        - how the video is being saved
    
    todo:
        - add "how to use this"
        - remove video section
        - add a help section
        - add a way to close the current video
    
    later:
        - ability to slow down video
        - ability to go back 5 seconds
        - add a delay time setting
        - add ability to change the save-as name
        - ability to open a folder and recursively get all videos
        - ability to have a "instant" value or a marker (maybe an M)
        - have the multiple levels for the feature recording
        - have the ability to add a list of videos to evaluate in order
        - have a short graph displaying the change
        - clean up the code
        - ability to enter a Null value
