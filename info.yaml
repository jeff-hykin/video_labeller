    description: An electron app designed to help people quickly label features on videos
    
    done:
        - clean up the code
        - ability to slow down video
        - ability to go back 5 seconds
        - add notification when speed changes
        - make up/down be a speed change
        - add input controls for rate of speed and skipBackAmount
        - fix the edgecase bug of the measuring tool being too short
        - use localstorage to save the last-used feature name, multiplier, and skipBack
        - disable the scroll wheel speed increase/decrease
        - remove the chunk storage
        - fix the proportions to work on a smaller screen
        - add a controls-explaination section
        
    todo:
        - add a help section
        - fix the performance issues with >= 3 features:
            - do this by having one static graph in the background (just scrolling)
            - and then another graph that is getting the real time recorded data
            - or do the stretched out method with CSS scrolling
        - graph:
            - allow toggling the displayed features
            - filter the feature names to be ones that are numbers
        - make save button hide again
        - have a "unsaved changes" feature, prevent accidental closing
    
    later:
        - add ability to change the save-as name
        - ability to open a folder and recursively get all videos
        - ability to enter a Null value
        - ability to have a "instant" value or a marker (maybe an M)
        - have the ability to add a list of videos to evaluate in order
