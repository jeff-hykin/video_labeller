    description: An electron app designed to help people quickly label features on videos
    
    done:
        - clean up the code
        - ability to slow down video
        - ability to go back 5 seconds
        - add notification when speed changes
        - make up/down be a speed change
        - add input controls for rate of speed and skipBackAmount
        - fix the edgecase bug of the measuring tool being too short
        - use localstorage to save the last-used feature name, multiplier, and skipBack
        - disable the scroll wheel speed increase/decrease
        - remove the chunk storage
        - fix the proportions to work on a smaller screen
        - add a controls-explaination section
    
    new-design:
        - show avalible keys
        - modes:
            - mouse mode
            - keyboard mode
        - on mode change:
            - detach, re-attach listeners
            - change the look of the bar
        - record previous position value every 1 second
        - add a marker value on keypress of 1,2, or 3
        - How to display marker on graph??
        - controls:
            shift + back arrow: slow down
            shift + forward arrow: speed up
            back arrow: go back 5 seconds
            forward arrow: go forward 5 sec
            up arrow: value up
            down arrow: value down
            click once: to start recording
            click again: to stop recording
            spacebar: play/pause
            hold down E: to erase recording
    
    todo:
        - labels with three keys positive negative or neutral
        - fix moving to next video without saving
        - recording mechanizism
        - show only current feature option
        - add a help section
        - fix the performance issues with >= 3 features:
            - do this by having one static graph in the background (just scrolling)
            - and then another graph that is getting the real time recorded data
            - or do the stretched out method with CSS scrolling
        - graph:
            - allow toggling the displayed features
            - filter the feature names to be ones that are numbers
        - make save button hide again
        - have a "unsaved changes" feature, prevent accidental closing
    
    later:
        - add ability to change the save-as name
        - ability to open a folder and recursively get all videos
        - ability to enter a Null value
        - ability to have a "instant" value or a marker (maybe an M)
        - have the ability to add a list of videos to evaluate in order
