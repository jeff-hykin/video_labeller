    done:
        - clean up the code
        - ability to slow down video
        - ability to go back 5 seconds
        - add notification when speed changes
        - make up/down be a speed change
        - add input controls for rate of speed and skipBackAmount
        - fix the edgecase bug of the measuring tool being too short
        
    todo:
        - disable the scroll wheel speed increase/decrease
        - use localstorage to save the last-used feature name, multiplier, and skipBack
        - add a controls section
        - add a help section
        - graph:
            - filter the names to be ones that are numbers
        - make save button hide again
    
    later:
        - add ability to change the save-as name
        - ability to open a folder and recursively get all videos
        - ability to enter a Null value
        - ability to have a "instant" value or a marker (maybe an M)
        - have the ability to add a list of videos to evaluate in order
